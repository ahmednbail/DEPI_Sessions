Learning programming is a journey, not a destination.
Every line of code you write makes you a little better.

Python is widely used in data engineering, web development,
automation, and artificial intelligence.

Mistakes are part of learning.
Debugging teaches you how things really work.

Keep practicing every day.
Consistency beats motivation.
